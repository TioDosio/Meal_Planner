# Meal_Planner

Ideas to explore:

- put an API on top of the meal planner to allow for easy access to the meal plan
- add a database to store receipes with the nutricutional information
- add an option to add a recipe to the meal plan with a link to the website and then its passes through the API to get the nutritional information and adapt the meal ingredients for the portions needed
